It was the third Blender \"open movie.\" It was produced by Ton Roosendaal, chairman of the Blender Foundation, written by Esther Wouda, and directed by Colin Levy, at the time an artist at Pixar. It was made at the Blender Institute, part of the Blender Foundation. The plot follows the character, Sintel, who is tracking down her pet Scales, a dragon. Just like the other Blender \"open movies,\" the film was made using Blender, a free and open source software application for animation, created and supported by the Blender Foundation."
